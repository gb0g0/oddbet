          In a world where emotions were traded like currency, there existed a
          unique crypto token known as "Depressed." In this society, emotions
          were no longer merely personal experiences but had been commodified
          and digitized. People could buy, sell, and trade their feelings on a
          digital marketplace, and emotions had become the new medium of
          exchange.

          Depressed was unlike any other emotion token. It held a special place
          in the hearts and minds of those who understood its true value. Unlike
          the popular tokens like Happiness, Excitement, and Love, which were in
          high demand, Depressed was the underdog of the emotional marketplace
